How to start:

    - run command 'python game.py {player-order} {size} {depth}'

        - player-order: 0 if you go first, 1 for computer

        - depth: computational depth of MinMax algorithm

    - To make a move

        - top-left of board: type '0,0'

        - bottom-left of board (of size n): type '0,n'

        - top-right of board (of size n): type 'n,0'
